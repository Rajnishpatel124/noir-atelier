           vertically centred, tall, large. Behind the grid text (z-0).
           The radial mask feathers every edge into the dark textured
           background (bright centre biased right), so the video appears to
           emerge from the background rather than sit in a box. */

           numeral filled. The box matches the video's portrait 2:3 aspect so
           the footage fills it edge-to-edge: no crop, no letterbox.

           The real dissolve is done by mix-blend-mode: lighten on the video
           (see .egv-video) — that erases the footage's black background into
           the page colour. The linear edge feathers here are a light secondary
           pass: they soften the bright hand where it nears an edge and fully
           mask away the footage's bright caption bar (bottom ~11%) so there is
           no bottom line. No radial → no halo, no tracing rings. The finger
           (top), rings and hand stay solid. */
